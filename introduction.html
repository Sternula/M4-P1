<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Peregrine falcons were placed on the endangered species list in 1970, due to DDT, habitat loss, hunting, and other factors. In addition to the ban on DDT, the implementation of fostering, hacking (young falcons slowly reintroduced to the wild in stages), and the release of over 6000 peregrines helped populations recover (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[1032:SRAROP]2.0.CO;2" title="Survival, recruitment, and rate of population change of the Peregrine Falcon population in Colorado">Craig, White, and Enderson 2004</a>).</p>
<p>With over 2000 breeding pairs in the United States, the population is again increasing, and falcons were removed from the endangered species list in 1999. There is renewed interest in harvesting peregrine falcons for falconry, and in May 2001 the US Fish and Wildlife Service allowed states west of the 100° longitude line (from North Dakota through Texas) to allow harvesting of up to 5% of nestling production. Falconers as a group have considerable interest in this outcome, as they contributed a huge, voluntary effort to foster and hack young birds during the recovery phase. For them, the new harvest permits are the payoff of a long and significant investment.</p>
<p>You are a state non-game bird biologist, and your task is to determine what level of take for falconry is allowed in your state (up to the maximum of 5%).</p>
<p>Biological parameters are given below; it is unclear whether two-year-old birds breed or not–in some studies they do, and at other places and times they do not.</p>
